Homework Assignment #4



Welcome to the cave, Crystal Collector! In order to take home the gems, you must use them to unlock the door
to the outside of the cave! Each gem has a hidden value, and you must use these values to match the number
on the door before you get caved in!

Click each gem to add a value to your score. You must match your number to the computers number to win. If you
go over, you lose. Each gem has a random value between 1 and 12, and it changes each time the game restarts. Just
click on any gem to start the game.
